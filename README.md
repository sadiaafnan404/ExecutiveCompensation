# ExecutiveCompensation
This repository contains the data, code, and documentation for my MSc Business Analytics dissertation project. The study investigates the relationship between CEO compensation structures (salary, bonus, equity) and firm performance measures (ROA, ROE, Tobinâ€™s Q, TSR), using a large panel dataset of 4,400 publicly listed companies.
