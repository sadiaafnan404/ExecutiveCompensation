# Executive Compensation and Company Performance: A Longitudinal Analysis of Top U.S. Firms

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between executive compensation and firm performance, with a focus on how financial structures such as leverage, liquidity, and asset growth influence incentive effectiveness. Using **17,511 firm-year records from 4,400 listed firms (2012‚Äì2020)**, the study applies descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and econometric preparation to examine the pay‚Äìperformance link.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Clean and analyze a large multi-year, multi-firm dataset.  
- **Financial Structure Analysis**: Build key ratios (leverage, liquidity, asset growth, investment intensity).  
- **Validation**: Use descriptive and correlation analysis, supported with visualizations.  
- **Theory Integration**: Link findings with Agency Theory, Managerial Power Theory, and governance frameworks.  
- **Policy Relevance**: Provide recommendations for boards, regulators, and investors.  

## üìä Key Findings
- Firms with stronger **liquidity** rely less on debt, supporting stable financing before incentives are effective.  
- **Asset growth** is highly volatile, reflecting cyclical investment patterns and risk when linked to short-term pay.  
- **Leverage and equity trade-offs** highlight the importance of aligning incentives with financial structure.  
- Sector differences matter: technology firms thrive on equity-based growth, while energy/utilities depend heavily on debt.  

## üèõ Practical Implications
- Align pay design with a firm‚Äôs **capital structure** to avoid risk mismatches.  
- Use **long-term equity-indexed incentives** with clawbacks to prevent short-termism.  
- Customize incentives by **industry context** rather than applying one-size-fits-all models.  
- Leverage and liquidity can serve as internal **benchmarks** when structuring executive pay.  

## üìö Contributions
- **Academic**: Extends pay‚Äìperformance debate by linking compensation design with financial structure.  
- **Practical**: Offers boards actionable insights to design sustainable incentive systems.  
- **Policy**: Supports global governance trends emphasizing transparency, clawbacks, and long-term alignment.  

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data processing and visualization  
- **Stata (xtabond2)** for System GMM econometric preparation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for reproducibility  
- **GitHub** for version control  

## üîÆ Future Work
- Incorporate **CEO-specific pay data** for richer causal analysis.  
- Apply **System GMM** to test cause-and-effect rigorously.  
- Explore **natural experiments** from regulatory reforms.  
- Expand to include **non-financial incentives** (ESG, innovation).
